KIDSCRYPTO

Hello Gitcoiner!

I'm a firm believer that the best way to give kids an education is to show them things that spark their interest, then let them explore on their own accord. When it comes to things like art, sports, and English, it's pretty easy to get kids curious.

On the other hand, is often an acquired taste. Lately, I've heard of teachers considering the use of blockchain in school curriculums as a way to spark interest in these fields within high school students. You know what? I'm all for it.

This project consiste for what !
consiste to incorporate blockchain of plenty of awesome ways : 

1- discuss and learn crypto with simple ways and the history of bitcoin.
2- kids play a game built on blockchain
3- Reward students with cryptocurrency tokens ( we can make owne token ) 
4- Hold a blockchain programming competition, and offer up prizes.
5- online courses to learn blockchain
6- others...


With your help, we will connect and develop the platform KIDS CRYPTO to build students futures together, and I will be able to devote special time to this public goods project.

I'm here if you want more information, or just DM!
